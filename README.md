# Multi-Signature Wallet

A secure and flexible multi-signature wallet implementation that requires multiple authorized signatures to execute transactions, providing enhanced security for digital asset management.

## Overview

This multi-signature wallet enables multiple parties to jointly manage digital assets through a consensus-based approval system. The wallet requires a predefined number of signatures from authorized signers before executing any transaction, making it ideal for organizational treasury management, shared funds, and high-security personal wallets.

## Core Components

### Wallet Contract
- Secure storage of digital assets
- Configurable signature threshold
- Support for multiple token standards (ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721)
- Transaction proposal and execution system
- Emergency pause functionality
- Gas optimization features
- Batch transaction support

### Signature Verification Contract
- Implements EIP-712 for structured data signing
- Signature validation and verification
- Replay attack protection
- Signature expiration mechanism
- Support for hardware wallet signatures
- Multiple signature schemes (EOA, Smart Contract Wallets)

### Key Management Contract
- Secure signer addition and removal
- Dynamic threshold adjustment
- Key rotation procedures
- Recovery mechanisms
- Access control management
- Signer metadata storage

### Transaction History Contract
- Comprehensive transaction logging
- Event indexing for easy querying
- Transaction status tracking
- Signature collection status
- Failed transaction logging
- Historical data retention policy

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Node.js â‰¥16.0.0
- Hardhat development environment
- ethers.js or Web3.js
- OpenZeppelin contracts

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multisig-wallet.git

# Install dependencies
cd multisig-wallet
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Guide

### Wallet Setup

```solidity
// Initialize wallet with signers and threshold
function initializeWallet(
    address[] memory _signers,
    uint256 _threshold
) external;
```

### Proposing Transactions

```solidity
// Propose a new transaction
function proposeTransaction(
    address _to,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _data
) external returns (uint256 transactionId);
```

### Signing Transactions

```solidity
// Sign a proposed transaction
function signTransaction(
    uint256 _transactionId
) external;
```

### Executing Transactions

```solidity
// Execute a transaction after threshold is met
function executeTransaction(
    uint256 _transactionId
) external;
```

## Security Features

- Time-locked transactions
- Daily spending limits
- Address whitelisting
- Hardware wallet compatibility
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Automated security checks

## Best Practices

1. Regular key rotation
2. Secure offline signature generation
3. Transaction review procedures
4. Emergency response planning
5. Access control audits
6. Backup procedures

## Security Considerations

- All contracts have undergone professional security audits
- Implementation of reentrancy guards
- Protection against signature replay attacks
- Secure randomness implementation
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Gas optimization techniques

## Recovery Procedures

1. Lost Key Recovery
    - Social recovery system
    - Timelock-based recovery
    - Guardian-assisted recovery

2. Emergency Procedures
    - Contract pause mechanism
    - Emergency fund withdrawal
    - Threshold adjustment

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage
